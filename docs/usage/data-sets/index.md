## Usage: Data Sets

The **`DataSet`** provides a simple abstraction over a plain-text row-column-structured data set. Data is represented as a list of rows, each of which is a list of strings, plus a list of string column labels. Data can be read from and written to CSV files, and filtered with relational-style selection and projection operations.
