## Usage: Data Sets

The <a href="https://quicksilver.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/apidocs/ciesvium/?uk/ac/standrews/cs/utilities/dataset/DataSet.html">DataSet</a>
provides a simple abstraction over a plain-text row-column-structured data set. Data is represented as a list of rows, each of which is a
list of strings, plus a list of string column labels. Data can be read from and written to CSV files, and filtered with relational-style
selection and projection operations.
