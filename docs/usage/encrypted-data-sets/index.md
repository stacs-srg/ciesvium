## Usage: Encrypted Data Sets

Encrypted data sets are based on **`EncryptedDataSet`**, a subclass of **`DataSet`**. They allow the persistent data to be encrypted using either symmetric or public key encryption. The latter offers the convenience of avoiding explicit key management for authorized users.
