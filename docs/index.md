## Home

This project provides some Java utility classes for handling text and numerical tables, encryption and file manipulation.

In particular, the *dataset* package and its sub-packages provide a simple abstraction over rectangular plain-text tables, with ability to import and export CSV files. It's also possible to define derived tables using relational-like select and project operations, and tables where the source data is held in encrypted form, with both symmetric and asymmetric encryption options.
