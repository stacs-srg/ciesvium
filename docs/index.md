## Home

This project provides some Java utility classes for handling text and numerical tables, encryption and file manipulation.

In particular, the [dataset](https://ciesvium.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/apidocs/index.html?uk/ac/standrews/cs/util/dataset/package-summary.html) package and its sub-packages provide a simple abstraction 
over rectangular plain-text tables, with ability to import and export CSV files. It's also possible to define derived tables using relational-like select and project operations, and tables
where the source data is held in encrypted form, with both symmetric and asymmetric encryption options.
